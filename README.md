# Tic-Tac-To [![](https://tokei.rs/b1/github/chibbi/Tic-Tac-To)]()
a simple Tic Tac To Game, written in Java

it is currently getting its expansion to multiplayer via the UDP protocoll.


#### currently writing my own UDP "Library" and stuff for that, when i am satisfied with that "Library", i will use it to create the Tic-Tac-To multiplayer.
