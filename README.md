# Tic-Tac-To [![](https://tokei.rs/b1/github/chibbi/Tic-Tac-To)]()
a simple Tic Tac To Game, written in Java

it is currently getting its expansion to multiplayer via the UDP protocoll.


#### I am pretty sure, that the way i use UDP is completly idiotic, and even though i dont want to use TCP, i probably will XD or i change it to be a peer to peer game (which makes more sense anyway, i just wanted to avoid it)
